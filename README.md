# react-context-lesson

We are going to replace our local state management from redux to the new context API. This repository is our application before we introduced sagas to handle our asynchronous code, which is a good starting point to make the appropriate changes!

# react-crown-clothing-context

It picks up from this commit 04e3eabad9e947373882eae999f2f80afbc3fb46.
